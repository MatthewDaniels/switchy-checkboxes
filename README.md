Switchy - iOS Style switches for checkboxes

This library can be used as a pure CSS (or LESS) implementation of iOS style switch styles for checkboxes
You can use this javascript to add the ability of the checkboxes to update their values based on data-attributes in the markup (making it a little less pure ;) )

With thanks to Bandar Raffah for the great work
on this pure CSS implementation:
